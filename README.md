# Testing the Data Structures

This collection of code contains slightly modified versions of the code found in the OSTEP chapter for concurrent data structures. I would like to you to simply spend some time and write a simple main program to exercise how the data structures work. All of your code will go into `main.c` and each data structure test is consolidated to a function.

The goal of writing the tests will be to evaluate how the code works by testing each of the functions provided by the respective data structure c files and manipulate the data structure with multiple threads (5 or so should be sufficient).

You can simply run `make` to build your main program and `./main` to execute your application.

## Submissions **MUST**:
* Compile and run without error
* Must have changes present to exercise the data structures with at least 5 threads maipulating the data structures with a counting large numbers, or storing/removing a large number of items (hash table, linked list, queue).

## Grade: 4 points
